# clojure-ttt

This is an implementation of tic tac toe written in Clojure, and using the
Speclj testing framework.

To run the project, you'll need to install [Clojure](https://clojure.org/),
[Leiningen](), and [Speclj](http://speclj.com/). (You can simply use `brew install
clojure` and `brew install leiningen` for the first two, see
[https://github.com/slagyr/speclj](https://github.com/slagyr/speclj) for Speclj.

You can run the tests with `lein spec`, and you can play the game in the
terminal with `lein run`.
